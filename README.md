A Simple Weather application for the android, web application, iOS, and Windows. I use react Native to develop the application from scratch. using the application program interface of OpenWeather's database. with all required assets. Thank you!
I build APK by using EXPO Software Development Kit for Android and dmg file for an iOS build I have used Xcode and Cocoapods.
